# Privacy Policy

## Introduction
**RedGuard Security (RGS)** and the **Operation Clean Fire** project ("we", "our", "us") respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and store data collected by the **Operation Clean Fire** bot ("the Bot") on Discord.

## Data We Collect
The Bot may collect the following types of data:
- **Usernames, Discriminators, and User IDs**: These are collected when the Bot scans a Discord server for suspicious profiles.
- **Profile Information**: This includes the user’s custom status, about me section, and activity (if applicable).
- **Server and Channel Information**: We gather server and channel data in order to provide alerts for suspicious profiles.

## How We Use the Data
The data we collect is used for the following purposes:
- **Identifying Suspicious Accounts**: We analyze user profile information to flag accounts with suspicious activities, including potential child exploitation or hacking-related behaviors.
- **Alert Generation**: Flagged accounts are logged in a **Firebase Realtime Database**, and alerts are sent to server moderators or administrators.
- **Logging**: We keep a log of flagged profiles for internal review and improvement of the Bot’s functionality.

## Data Storage
Data collected by the Bot is stored in a **Firebase Realtime Database**. This data may be stored indefinitely unless manually removed by an administrator or upon a user’s request for data deletion.

## Third-Party Services
We use **Firebase** to store and manage data. Firebase is a service provided by **Google**, and by using our Bot, you agree to the collection and storage practices of Firebase. Please refer to Firebase’s Privacy Policy for more information.

## Data Security
We take reasonable precautions to protect your data. However, no data transmission or storage system is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.

## Data Deletion
You may request the deletion of your personal data by contacting us at **redguardpen@gmail.com**. Upon request, we will delete your data from our logs and databases.

## Your Rights
As a user, you have the right to:
- Request access to your personal data.
- Request deletion of your personal data.
- Opt-out of specific data collection or processing activities.

## Changes to the Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be communicated through our GitHub page or Discord.
